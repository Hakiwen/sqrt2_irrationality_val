Comparison of outputs between Claude and GPT4 chats on the following prompt:

`Can you give me a coq proof that the square root of two is irrational, and that will compile.`

The solution comes from [io12](https://github.com/io12) in [coq-proofs](https://github.com/io12/coq-proofs/tree/master)

Result: neither generates valid coq. 

I hope to update this with future attempts.
