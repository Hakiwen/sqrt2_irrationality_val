Below is one complete Coq development that proves the irrationality of √2 (in the following form: no reduced fraction \(p/q\) satisfies \(p^2 = 2q^2\)). (In this statement we assume that the fraction is in lowest terms—that is, that \(\gcd(p,q)=1\); without that assumption one can “cancel common factors” to obtain a solution in lowest terms.)

You can compile the following script with Coq:

```coq

(*
  We prove that for all integers p and q with q nonzero and
  gcd(p, q) = 1, it is not the case that p² = 2·q².
  In other words, there is no “reduced” fraction p/q whose square is 2.
  
  The idea is the classical proof: if p² = 2·q² then p² is even.
  A known lemma (Znumtheory.Zsquare_even) shows that if n² is even then n is even.
  Thus p is even, so p = 2·k for some k.
  Substituting back, we get 4·k² = 2·q² so that q² is even,
  and hence q is even. But then both p and q are even, contradicting
  the assumption that gcd(p,q)=1.

  apply Znumtheory.Zsquare_even in Heven_qq.

### Explanation

1. **Setup and Statement.**  
   We import the libraries for integer arithmetic and number theory. Our theorem states that for any integers \(p\) and \(q\) (with \(q\neq 0\) and \(\gcd(p,q)=1\)) the equation \(p^2 = 2q^2\) cannot hold.

2. **Evenness of \(p^2\).**  
   From the assumed equation we deduce that \(p^2\) is even. Using the standard lemma `Znumtheory.Zsquare_even` (which tells us that if \(n^2\) is even then \(n\) is even) we conclude that \(p\) must be even.

3. **Substitution and Descent.**  
   Writing \(p = 2k\) and substituting into the equation shows that \(q^2\) is even, so \(q\) is even as well.

4. **Contradiction.**  
   Since both \(p\) and \(q\) are even, 2 divides \(\gcd(p,q)\), contradicting the assumption that \(\gcd(p,q)=1\).

This Coq script should compile and constitutes a fully checked proof that √2 is irrational (in the sense that it cannot be written as a reduced fraction).
