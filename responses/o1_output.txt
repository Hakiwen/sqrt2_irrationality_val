Selecting the approach

I’m working through the Coq proof to establish the irrationality of sqrt(2), ensuring it compiles correctly. This involves expressing the irrationality and verifying the proof's accuracy in Coq.

Formulating irrationality

I’m mapping out the irrationality of a real number in Coq, defining it as not being expressible as a fraction of integers, and planning to utilize Coq's standard definitions for rational and real numbers, including the irrationality of sqrt 2.

Crafting irrational concepts

I’m piecing together a plan to define irrational numbers, outline the theorem for sqrt(2) being irrational, and provide a proof. I’m also considering leveraging Coq's standard definitions and existing proofs.

Proving irrationality

I’m starting by opening the necessary libraries and defining irrational numbers. Then, I state and aim to prove the theorem that sqrt 2 is irrational.

Examining terminology

I’m working through defining and distinguishing rational and irrational numbers. The theorem is about demonstrating that 22

​ is irrational.

Making a case

To prove 22

​ is irrational, I assume it's rational. This leads me to square both sides, simplifying, and then falsifying the rational assumptions.

Validating consistency

I’m demonstrating the consistency of the integer representation by establishing that 2=(IZRp)2(IZRq)22=(IZRq)2(IZRp)2​. This involves equating and simplifying expressions to show that pp and qq share parity.

Examining the implications

OK, so I’m digging into the fact that if 22

​ were rational, it could be expressed as pqqp​ in its simplest form. This suggests pp and qq are coprime.

Locating the proof

I’m gathering info on the irrationality of sqrt 2 in Coq, looking through the standard library and repositories for an existing proof. This aims to ensure compatibility and compile successfully.

Defining irrational numbers

I’m thinking about how to define irrational numbers in Coq, focusing on real numbers that are not rational. Considering definitions and aiming to prove the irrationality of sqrt 2.

chunk

Mapping out proof steps

OK, let's assume 2=pq2

​=qp​, with pp and qq being integers with no common factor, and then go through the implications of this assumption.

Unveiling irrationality

OK, let me see. I’m working through formalizing the proof of √2 being irrational in Coq by leveraging integer types and pairs to represent rational numbers.

Mathematical definitions

I’m setting the stage by defining rational and irrational numbers using Coq's formalism. For instance, rational specifies conditions for a number to be expressed as a ratio of integers, while irrational denotes the lack of these rational conditions.

Taking a closer look

I’ve noticed that pp and qq being even contradicts gcd(p,q)=1gcd(p,q)=1.

Adjustments and Imports

Taking a closer look

I'm gathering info on the lemma Z_even_pow: if Z.even (n * n) is true, then Z.even n must also be true. Considering other approaches in Coq for precision.

Establishing connections

I’m noting that squaring both sides reveals 2 * q^2 = p^2, showing p and q are both even. This contradicts their gcd being 1.

Piecing together lemmas

I’m preparing to check for errors and considering using Zeven_def in Coq’s ZArith library. Also, exploring a lemma for the converse implication of Z.even_pow.

Formulating a lemma

I’m mapping out the potential for a lemma in Coq to establish that Z.even (n * n) equals Z.even n. This involves exploring standard number theory results and existing theorems that might already support this.

Verifying even parity

I start by checking if n is even using Z.even_spec, then show that n^2 is also even. Next, I confirm n is odd using Zodd_spec and demonstrate that n^2 remains odd.

Piecing together

I’m verifying the lemma that if p^2 and q^2 are even, p and q must be even. This shows 22

​ is irrational, confirming the lemma.

Cross-multiplying and simplifying

I’m trying to prove 2=pq2

​=qp​ by cross-multiplying, simplifying, and using properties of integer squares and gcd. This leads me to conclude that both pp and qq must be even, which contradicts gcd⁡(p,q)=1gcd(p,q)=1.

Ensuring lemma accuracy

Yes, here's a Coq proof that the square root of two is irrational, which should compile correctly. This proof follows the classic proof by contradiction, assuming that 22

​ is rational and deriving a contradiction.

This proof uses standard Coq libraries for real numbers (Reals), integers (ZArith), and number theory (Znumtheory). It defines rational and irrational numbers, then proceeds to prove that 22

​ cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers with no common factors, leading to a contradiction.

You can compile this code using Coq's interactive environment or compile it from the command line. Make sure you have the Coq proof assistant installed on your system.
