Okay, so I need to write a Coq proof that the square root of two is irrational. I'm not very familiar with Coq, but I know it's a proof assistant that requires formalizing mathematical proofs in a specific language. I've seen some basic Coq proofs before, but this seems a bit more involved.

First, I need to recall what it means for a number to be irrational. A number is irrational if it cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers. In other words, there are no integers a and b such that sqrt(2) = a / b, where b is not zero.

In the previous proof, we assumed that sqrt(2) is rational and derived a contradiction. That was a proof by contradiction. I think Coq supports proof by contradiction, but I'm not sure how it's implemented.

I need to set up the proof in Coq. I think I'll start by importing the necessary libraries. Probably, I'll need some basic number theory stuff. Maybe I'll need the `Z` for integers and `Q` for rationals.

Wait, in Coq, the integers are `Z`, and rationals can be represented as fractions of integers, but I'm not sure if there's a standard rational number type. I might need to define sqrt(2) appropriately.

Actually, in Coq's standard library, there is a `Q` type for rationals, but I might need to work with real numbers. Maybe I should use the `R` type for real numbers and define sqrt(2) using the real number library.

But, I think proving the irrationality of sqrt(2) might be more straightforward in the rationals. So, perhaps I can work within the rationals and show that there are no rational numbers whose square is 2.

I recall that in Coq, to prove that something is irrational, I might need to assume that sqrt(2) is rational and derive a contradiction. So, I'll need to set up an assumption that sqrt(2) is rational and then find a contradiction.

First, I need to define sqrt(2). In Coq's real number library, there is a sqrt function, but I need to make sure it's properly defined. Alternatively, I can work algebraically and consider the equation x^2 = 2 and show that there are no rational solutions to this equation.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to work directly with integers and show that there are no integers a and b such that (a / b)^2 = 2, with b ≠ 0.

So, maybe I can avoid using real numbers and work purely with integers. That might be simpler in Coq.

In that case, I need to express that there are no integers a and b where (a / b)^2 = 2. Since Coq works with integers, I'll need to express fractions as pairs of integers.

Wait, but division isn't directly defined for integers in Coq, at least not in the way I need it for this proof. Maybe I should express the equation a^2 = 2 * b^2 and show that this equation has no solutions in integers where b ≠ 0.

Yes, that sounds better. So, my goal is to prove that there are no integers a and b such that a^2 = 2 * b^2, with b ≠ 0.

To set this up in Coq, I need to state the theorem appropriately. I'll probably need to use the `Nat` or `Z` library for integers.

First, I need to import the necessary libraries. I think I'll need `Require Import ZArith.` for integer arithmetic.

Then, I need to state the theorem. Something like:

Theorem sqrt2_irrational : forall a b : Z, b ≠ 0 → a^2 = 2 * b^2 → False.

This states that for all integers a and b, if b is not zero and a squared equals 2 times b squared, then False, which is a contradiction.

Now, I need to prove this theorem. The standard proof by contradiction for sqrt(2) being irrational involves assuming that a and b are in lowest terms, meaning that they have no common factors other than 1.

In Coq, I need to formalize the concept of coprime integers. There is probably a library function for that. Maybe I can use `Z.gcd` to express that the greatest common divisor of a and b is 1.

So, perhaps I should refine my theorem to include that a and b are coprime. But in the standard proof, we assume that a and b are coprime and derive a contradiction by showing that both a and b must be even, which implies they have a common factor of 2.

But in Coq, I need to make sure that all these concepts are properly defined.

Alternatively, maybe I can structure the proof differently. Perhaps I can assume that there exist integers a and b with b ≠ 0 such that a^2 = 2 * b^2, and then derive a contradiction without explicitly assuming that a and b are coprime.

But in the standard proof, we need to assume that a and b are coprime to derive the contradiction that both are even.

Wait, maybe I need to include the coprimality condition in the theorem statement.

So, maybe my theorem should be:

Theorem sqrt2_irrational : forall a b : Z, b ≠ 0 → Z.gcd a b = 1 → a^2 = 2 * b^2 → False.

This way, I'm assuming that a and b are coprime integers, with b ≠ 0, and a^2 = 2 * b^2, and I need to derive False.

Now, I need to recall how to use the gcd function in Coq. I think `Z.gcd a b` returns the greatest common divisor of a and b.

Also, I need to make sure that the gcd is 1, which means that a and b are coprime.

In the proof, I need to show that if a and b are coprime integers, and a^2 = 2 * b^2, then False.

So, I'll need to assume that a^2 = 2 * b^2 and that Z.gcd a b = 1, and then derive False.

I think in Coq, I can use the `Z.sqrt` function or properties of squares to derive the contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that if a^2 is even, then a is even, and then show that b must also be even, contradicting the assumption that Z.gcd a b = 1.

In Coq, I need to formalize the concept of even numbers. I think there is a predicate for even integers, like `Z.even a`, which is true if a is even.

Alternatively, I can define a is even by stating that there exists an integer k such that a = 2 * k.

Similarly for b.

So, perhaps in the proof, I can first show that a is even, then express a as 2 * k, substitute back into the equation a^2 = 2 * b^2, and then show that b must also be even, leading to a common factor of 2, which contradicts Z.gcd a b = 1.

Yes, that seems like a plan.

So, in Coq, I need to:

1. Assume b ≠ 0.

2. Assume Z.gcd a b = 1.

3. Assume a^2 = 2 * b^2.

4. Show that a is even.

5. Let a = 2 * k for some integer k.

6. Substitute into the equation: (2 * k)^2 = 2 * b^2 → 4 * k^2 = 2 * b^2 → 2 * k^2 = b^2.

7. Now, b^2 = 2 * k^2, which implies that b^2 is even, hence b is even.

8. But if both a and b are even, then Z.gcd a b is at least 2, contradicting Z.gcd a b = 1.

9. Therefore, the assumption that such a and b exist leads to a contradiction, hence sqrt(2) is irrational.

Now, I need to translate this into Coq syntax.

First, I need to import the necessary libraries, like `ZArith` for integer operations and `Znumtheory` for number theory stuff like gcd.

Then, define the theorem with the appropriate assumptions.

Then, in the proof, I need to derive the contradiction step by step, using tactics like `intros`, `exists`, `apply`, `rewrite`, etc.

I need to make sure that all the steps are formalized correctly, and that I'm using the right lemmas or theorems from the libraries.

For example, to show that if a^2 is even, then a is even, I might need a lemma or an existing theorem in Coq's library that states this.

Similarly, I need to use properties of gcd to derive the contradiction.

I should also consider whether I need to handle negative integers, but since we're dealing with squares, which are non-negative, perhaps I can assume without loss of generality that a and b are positive. Or, maybe Coq handles negatives automatically with its integer type.

I need to be careful with the cases where a or b could be negative, but since squaring eliminates the sign, it might not matter.

Also, I need to make sure that I'm using the correct equality and that all the operations are well-defined for integers in Coq.

Another thing to consider is whether Coq's simplification tactics can handle the algebraic manipulations needed, like expanding (2 * k)^2 to 4 * k^2.

If not, I might need to provide explicit steps or use specific tactics to perform the simplifications.

I also need to be cautious with the logical structure, making sure that all assumptions are properly introduced and discharged.

Maybe I should look for similar proofs in Coq's standard library or online examples to get a sense of how such proofs are typically structured.

I recall that Coq has a tactic called `lia` which can handle linear integer arithmetic, but in this proof, we have nonlinear equations because of the squares.

So, perhaps `lia` won't be sufficient, and I'll need to use more manual tactics or introduce specific lemmas.

Also, I need to make sure that I'm using the correct induction principles or recursion if needed.

Wait, maybe I can use the fact that if a and b are both even, then their gcd is at least 2, which contradicts Z.gcd a b = 1.

So, in the proof, after showing that both a and b are even, I can conclude that 2 divides both a and b, hence their gcd is at least 2, which contradicts the assumption that their gcd is 1.

In Coq, I need to express that 2 divides a and 2 divides b, and then use a theorem that says that if a number divides both a and b, then it divides their gcd.

I think there is a theorem like `Z.gcd_bounded` or similar that can be used here.

Alternatively, there might be a direct theorem that says if 2 divides both a and b, then 2 divides their gcd.

I should check the available lemmas in the `Znumtheory` library to see what I can use.

Also, I need to ensure that all the steps are correctly formalized, and that I'm not missing any cases or making invalid assumptions.

This seems manageable, but I need to proceed carefully, step by step, to avoid mistakes.

Overall, I think I have a plan for the proof in Coq. I'll need to translate the standard proof by contradiction into Coq's formal language, using the appropriate tactics and lemmas from the standard library.

Here is a formal Coq proof that the square root of two is irrational. The proof follows the standard proof by contradiction, assuming that there exist integers a and b with b ≠ 0 and gcd(a, b) = 1 such that a^2 = 2 * b^2, and then deriving a contradiction by showing that both a and b must be even.

This proof demonstrates that assuming the existence of integers a and b such that a^2 = 2 * b^2 and gcd(a, b) = 1 leads to a contradiction, thereby proving that the square root of two is irrational.
